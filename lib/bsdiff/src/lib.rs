//! # Varia: `bsdiff`
//!
//! A [`bsdiff`] implementation for [Varia], brought to you by
//! [@NikolaiVazquez]!
//!
//! This library is developed as part of the [Ocean Package Manager][Ocean].
//!
//! The binary diffing algorithm by Colin Percival is described in his
//! ["Na√Øve Differences of Executable Code"][paper] paper.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! This crate is available [on crates.io][crate] and can be used by adding the
//! following to your project's [`Cargo.toml`]:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! varia-bsdiff = "0.0.0"
//! ```
//!
//! and this to your crate root (`main.rs` or `lib.rs`):
//!
//! ```rust
//! extern crate varia_bsdiff;
//! ```
//!
//! This last step is optional in [Rust 2018 edition][2018].
